A summary of how the code runs
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**



*   The weather data is loaded from a CSV file.
*   The index is converted to datetime format.
*   A subset of the data is selected where the minute is 0 and the hour is divisible by 3.
*   The "Tdew (degC)" column is considered as the target temperature, and the remaining columns are used as input variables.
*   The data is normalized using Standard Scaling.

2. **Creating Sequences and Targets:**

*   Sequences of length 56 are created from the input variables.
*   Targets are assigned that represent the target temperature 7 steps ahead of the sequences.
3. **Building the RNN Model:**

*   A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is built with 4 GRU layers, each with 128 units.
*   Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting.
*   tanh activation is used for the GRU layers and ReLU activation is used for the dense layer.

4. **Compiling and Training the Model:**

*   The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
*   The Mean Absolute Error function is used as the loss function.
*   The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 50, and validation data is used to monitor performance.

5. **Evaluation and Prediction:**

*   The performance of the model is evaluated using the test data.
*   The model is used to predict the target temperature for the test data.
*   A plot of the predicted and actual values is drawn for comparison.

6. **Saving the Model:**

*   The model weights are saved to an HDF5 file for future use.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The code is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow library.
*   The model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, units, and epochs.
*   The code can be adapted to other datasets and tasks by modifying the data loading, preprocessing, and model architecture.
